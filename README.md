This repository contains the code and analysis for evaluating the prognostic value of gene signatures derived from RANK overexpression in luminal epithelial cells in breast cancer survival. The analysis is performed using the METABRIC dataset, a comprehensive resource for breast cancer genomics and clinical data. The goal is to confirm whether RANK-associated gene signatures can predict patient survival outcomes and serve as potential biomarkers for breast cancer prognosis.
